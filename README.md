# Teacher curriculum exercise tracker

In order to track and get feedback on the exercises made for the [Teacher curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/teacher-curriculum) we have made this repo. 

The repo works as a kanban board to track the exercises. 

## How do i hand in exercises?

Create a new issue and select the `exercise-template` template. 

Now the title should be the title of the exercise you are doing. Add the github link to the exercise so its easy to know which questions you are answering.

Beneath the three lines `---` add your solution to the exercise. That can be written text plainly written in the issue. But you can also add it to a github repo, a google docs link, medium post, whatever. As long as the solution is there :) 

Take a look at this issue for inspiration: https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/teacher-curriculum-exercise-tracker/issues/1
